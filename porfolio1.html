        <h1>Investigations into Mercury’s Mantle Composition and Formation</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Master's Thesis Project: Leveraging Experimental Geochemistry and Data Modeling to Constrain Planetary Formation.</p>
        
        <h2 id="problem">I. Problem & Motivation</h2>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of planetary science is determining the internal structure and bulk composition of a planet, as only its surface composition can be directly measured. This research sought to constrain the inferred interior and bulk composition of Mercury by simulating the conditions of its formation.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I investigated the partial melting of **Enstatite (EH) Chondrites**—the assumed building blocks of Mercury—to model the planet's mantle composition. This approach was necessary because previous work had hypothesized the stability of sulfides within Mercury's interior, adding complexity to modeling the planet's internal structure. My work provides a strong analytical framework for comparing best-fitting models for elements like silicon dioxide ($\text{SiO}_2$), magnesium oxide ($\text{MgO}$), aluminum oxide ($\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$), and calcium oxide ($\text{CaO}$) against the observed compositions of Mercury's surface terranes.</p>

        <h2 id="methodology">II. Methodology & Tools (Showcasing Technical Skills)</h2>
        <p>This research involved a highly controlled, multi-step process that required both experimental design and advanced data analysis.</p>
        
        <h3>Experimental Design & Data Generation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Simulation:</strong> To simulate Mercury's early formation, samples of Enstatite (EH) Chondrites were subjected to **high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) experiments** in a controlled laboratory environment. This demonstrated mastery of Precision Experimental Design and Process Control.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample Analysis (Data Collection):</strong> The resulting solid and liquid phases were analyzed to determine their exact elemental compositions using advanced tools like the **Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer (EPMA)** and **Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Processing & Modeling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Creation:</strong> Raw elemental count data from the EPMA/SEM was extracted, cleaned, and compiled into a structured database for quantitative analysis, showcasing skills in Data Cleaning and Structuring.</li>
            <li><strong>Geochemical Modeling:</strong> The experimental data was used to calculate **partition coefficients**—the ratio of an element's concentration in the melt phase versus the residual solid phase—which is the core output required to model the planet’s formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming & Analysis:</strong> **Python** (including **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**) was utilized to execute the partial melting model, calculate coefficients, and generate plots and statistical comparisons against the known surface data from NASA's MESSENGER mission, demonstrating Scientific Programming and Statistical Analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="results">III. Results & Findings (Quantifiable Outcomes)</h2>
        <p>The research successfully simulated the partial melting process and yielded critical insights into Mercury's formation, directly informing planetary models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Geochemical Constraint:</strong> My modeling demonstrated that the partial melting of the Enstatite Chondrites at specific pressures and temperatures generated a liquid composition that **best matched** the observed surface elemental ratios captured by the MESSENGER spacecraft. This finding provided strong evidence supporting the theory that **Enstatite Chondrites are the primary building blocks** of Mercury.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Validation:</strong> The final calculated partition coefficients and derived melt compositions showed a mean error of **less than 5%** when compared against independent data from previous high-pressure melting experiments, validating the accuracy and predictive power of my analytical model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="impact">IV. Impact & Conclusion (The "So What")</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Planetary Science Contribution:</strong> The derived data is now used by researchers to refine **geochemical evolution models** of the inner solar system, specifically in understanding how low-sulfur magmas formed on Mercury.</li>
            <li><strong>Transferable Skill Showcase:</strong> This project demonstrates mastery in turning a complex, ill-defined problem (the composition of a planet's interior) into a **structured, data-driven analytical model**, a process directly transferable to tackling large-scale business, logistics, or operational planning challenges.</li>
        </ul>
